    <li>View all chamber profiles</li>
    <li>Save images of data graphs</li>
    <li>View lab temperature and humidity</li>
</ul>

<h5>Profiles</h5>
<p>Profiles are sets of set points and thresholds distributed over time. The profiles are 
    meant to be used to cycle hardware products through different environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Profiles are stored differently depending on the machine's manufacture, protocol or function. Because of 
    this the machines were modeled in code as a hiearchy of classes inheriting from one another. The base class 
    was the "Device" class that had three descendants; "GPIBDevice", "ModbusDevice", "WebDevice".
